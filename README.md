March 2024 | GitHub Demo: https://govardhanreddy001.github.io/Train_Tatkhal2/

Built an educational prototype to simulate how Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools like UiPath can streamline repetitive tasks in ticket booking systems.

Designed a mock frontend and used Excel sheets to simulate user data input and storage.

Automated the form-filling and booking workflow to demonstrate how RPA can enhance user experience in high-traffic environments.
